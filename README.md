A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) compiler written in Haskell

## Why?

I told a friend that one could write a Brainfuck compiler in a weekend and so I challenged myself to write a very basic one in 2 days. I succeeded :)

## What can('t) it do?

You can give it a path to a Brainfuck source file and it'll compile and run it. There's no actual CLI and it can't output a binary.

## What Brainfuck features/versions does it support?

Uhhh..All of them?

## Do you plan on doing anything else with this?

Yes, such as making it actually compile instead of running the Brainfuck code in a VM and giving it an actual CLI, maybe even a REPL. 
It's a fun project but at the bottom of my list of things to do.

## Eww Haskell

A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's so hard to understand :^)

## Your Haskell is not very good

I know, it's not a language I've gotten much chance to do things in. I'll clean it up as I learn more about and do more with it.
